 
 * add option to split out individual channels
   
 * triangle wave does not sound right!
 
 * start on DMC channel
 
 * make everything sound right!
 
 * how to package and run from command line? Make a maven target to 
   create a fat jar.
 
 * get this thing on github!

 
 -- TAKE A BREAK -- 
 
 * capture APU writes and try to output something higher level.
   perhaps implement a higherlevel APU that outputs sound samples
   for each "period" basic on the current state of registers and whatever
   updates have occurred.
   
   while( time <= maxTime ) {
   
       generateAPUSamples();
       runPlayRoutine();
   
       time += playPeriodTime;
   }
   
  * output apu changes to impulse tracker stuff

 * ".itm" or impulse tracker files to midi to generate a score?
 
 Creating something that converts between itm vs midi might be a project on it's own.
